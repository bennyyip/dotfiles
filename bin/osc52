# osc52 - copy stdin or files to tmux using OSC 52
#
# This utility copies up to 74,994 bytes, from stdin or from files
# specified on the command line, to the controlling tty using OSC 52
# escape codes and base64 encoding. This allows terminals that support
# OSC 52 to copy the data into the system clipboard.  The supporting
# terminal must obviously (a) support OSC 52 and (b) have permission
# to access the clipboard.
#
# This works under Mac OS X iTerm2 when you enable "Applications in
# terminal may access clipboard."  It ought to work under Linux with
# xterm, or with urxvt using an extension with support such as
# https://github.com/parantapa/dotfiles/blob/master/urxvt-perl/52-osc.
#
# For the specification see the section Operating System Controls,
# code 52, Manipulate Selection Data, in Xterm Control Sequences
# (https://www.xfree86.org/current/ctlseqs.html).
#
# "Ps = 52 -> Manipulate Selection Data.  These controls may be
# disabled using the allowWindowOps resource.  The parameter Pt is
# parsed as [Pc ; Pd]. The first, Pc, may contain any character from
# the set [c p s 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7]. It is used to construct a list of
# selection parameters for clipboard, primary, select, or cut buffers
# 0 through 7 respectively, in the order given.  If the parameter is
# empty, xterm uses s0 to specify the configurable primary/clipboard
# selection and cut buffer 0.  The second parameter, Pd, gives the
# selection data.  Normally this is a string encoded in base64.  The
# data becomes the new selection, which is then available for pasting
# by other applications.  If the second parameter is a ?, xterm
# replies to the host with the selection data encoded using the same
# protocol."

# The maximum length of an OSC 52 escape sequence is 100,000 bytes,
# including the 7-byte header "\033]52;c;", the 1-byte footer "\007",
# and then the base64 encoded contents. Since base64 consumes 4 bytes
# for every 3 bytes of input, we have a limit of 74,994 bytes for the
# unencoded data.
